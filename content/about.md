I did my undegraduate maths studies at EPFL (1st and 2nd year), ENS Ulm (3rd year) and the University Bonn (4th and 5th year). Here is my [academical CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jJUhM4yMhBtxE3LvqHcKW4w6qBXNdWCz/view?usp=drive_link).

I was born in [Vevey, Switzerland](https://live.staticflickr.com/7145/13876814383_ddf0a5a9de_b.jpg), and I grew up there.

If I had inifnite time, I would like, apart from doing maths, to write stories and essays, and getting way better at badminton.

Here is a picture of me if you were wondering. ![Myself](/images/recadre.jpg)
