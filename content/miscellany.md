Apart from doing maths, I enjoy playing competitive Badminton. This season, I am head of competition at [LUC Badminton](https://lucbadminton.ch/).

This website is a [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/), with [typo theme](https://github.com/tomfran/typo). Here is my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/leo-nc-git/website). I used GitHub Actions to deploy this website.

The icon of the website is a minimal art of _Gon_ from _Hunter X Hunter_, a manga I like really much.
