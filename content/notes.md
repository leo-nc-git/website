Here is a collection of various mathematical notes.

[Mapping spaces of 1-truncated animated rings and transmuted gerbes](/pdf/1ani.pdf) _We explain how to compute mapping spaces between 1-truncated animated rings, and why we get natural gerbes on so called transmuted stacks from Bhatt's notes [prismatic F-Gauges](https://www.math.ias.edu/~bhatt/teaching/mat549f22/lectures.pdf) ._

[Perfectoid rings](/pdf/pfd.pdf). _A colletion of basic facts about perfectoid rings. Included is a general tilting equivalence, a proof of almost purity for fields and miscellany on completions._

[Witt vectors from deformation theory](/pdf/wittdef.pdf). _Finding addition and multiplication of Witt Vectors from deformation theory. Included is a recollection on deformation theory._

[Six-functor formalisms](/pdf/6ff.pdf). _Lecture notes from [Marc Hoyois](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/) course at the [2023 YTM](https://archiveweb.epfl.ch/ytm2023.epfl.ch/). Updated from the YTM website version._

[Moduli and automorphisms](/pdf/moduli.pdf). _Quick note to explain the saying that "automorphisms are obstruction to representability of moduli"._

[Adjoint functor theorems](/pdf/prescat.pdf). _Notes on presentable categories and the adjoint functor theorem._
