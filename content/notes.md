Here is a collection of various mathematical notes.

[Perfectoid rings](/pdf/pfd.pdf). _A colletion of basic facts about perfectoid rings. Included is a general tilting equivalence, a proof of almost purity for fields and miscellany on completions._

[Witt vector from deformation theory](/pdf/wittdef.pdf). _Finding addition and multiplication of Witt Vectors from deformation theory. Included is a recollection on deformation theory._

[Six-functor formalisms](/pdf/6ff.pdf). _Lecture notes from [Marc Hoyois](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/) course at the [2023 YTM](https://archiveweb.epfl.ch/ytm2023.epfl.ch/). Updated from the YTM website version._

[Adjoint functor theorems](/pdf/prescat.pdf). _Notes on presentable categories and the adjoint functor theorem._
