My research focus on using perfectoid and prismatic techniques to various close problems. For example I am interested in understanding more clearly perfectoidizations. I am also interested in getting vanishing results in the prismatic setup.

Some keywords (in a more or less random order) I use/know/like/do research about/am interested in/etc. _Perfectoids, prismatic cohomology, generic vanishing, geometrization, motives, six-functor formalisms, motivic methods to prove vansihing theorems, infinity-categories, condensed maths, (higher) stacks, affine stacks, deformation theory,(infinity) topos theory, (higher) Galois theory Ã  la Grothendieck,etc._
